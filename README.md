# Simple HTML and CSS Webpage (Course Assignment)

## Description:
This is the GitHub version of my CodePen assignment.
The purpose of the assignment was to demonstrate understanding of HTML and CSS by creating a short webpage.
(The webpage is about cultural surprises of the USVI).

The webpage had to follow specific criteria, including:

- It should be about something I like
- It should contain at least 100 words
- It should include at least three images, with at least one centred on the page regardless of viewport width
- Since free-tier CodePen users cannot upload images, I had to use publicly accessible image URLs
- It should include a list (ordered or unordered)
- All CSS should be written inside the CSS tab on CodePen (not inline)
- Both HTML and CSS should be free of syntax errors

## Repo contains:
- an HTML file and a CSS file
- images referenced from external URLs

## How to run:
- To run it locally, you can download or clone the repo and open the HTML file in any browser.
- You can also visit the GitHub Pages link in the above section.

## Purpose of this repo:
To familiarise myself with GitHub and practice publishing a webpage using GitHub Pages
