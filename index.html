  <h1> The US Virgin Islands </h1>

<p>The US Virgin Islands are warm, gorgeous, and full of surprises. The little differences are sometimes funny, sometimes a bit of a hassle, but they are really what make the islands so different from what I'm used to.</p>

<p>The three main islands are <strong>St Thomas </strong> (the busy one), <strong>St Croix</strong> (the big one), and <strong>St John </strong>(the posh one with the most beautiful beaches). St Thomas and St John are close - about 20 min by ferry, while St Croix is about 2 hours and 15 min away from St Thomas by ferry or only 20 min by plane. The islands are small but in St Thomas, for instance, it could take 2 hours to get from one end to the other simply because of traffic. There are only a few main roads, so once it’s stuck, it’s properly stuck. You also have to stay alert because of the narrow, twisting roads, potholes, and overconfident drivers.</p>

<p>Fascinatingly, people drive on the <span class="bold">left</span>, like here in the UK, but the steering wheel is also on the <span class="bold">left</span>!!! Presumably because it is easier to import cars from the US. It feels wrong, after all how could you possibly see when overtaking? But then again, maybe you shouldn't… Unsurprisingly, this causes a lot of accidents because tourists get confused. You see a lot of signs reminding people to <em>keep left</em>.</p>

<p>Another thing that feels odd is the sun. Being so close to the equator doesn’t only mean constant heat - it also means the sun sets between 6 and 7 pm all year round. For anyone used to long summer evenings in Europe, that takes some getting used to.</p>

<h2>Island life: 10 things that stand out</h2>

<ol>
  <li><span class="bold">Island time</span> - shops and banks can open (or close) when they feel like it</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Local English</span> - even native English speakers need time to get used to it</li>
  <li><span class="bold">The heat</span> - all year, but summer even hotter</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Iguanas and lizards</span> - adorable little dragons everywhere</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Bugs</span> - huge cucarachas (=cockroaches), mosquitoes, termites, and cheeky sand flies are just part of life</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Stock roulette</span> - if you see something you like, buy it, you never know when or if it will be available again</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Power cuts</span> - on St Thomas, going without for 24 hours (or more) isn’t unusual</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Cistern water</span> - not for drinking (without getting sick), and you have to buy water which adds up</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Expensive living</span> - a weekly shop for two can easily reach $300. Internet can cost over $100 per month, not to mention rent and bills</li>
  <li><span class="bold">Greetings</span> - “Good morning” is expected, “hi” is rude; “Good night” isn’t goodbye, it is often hello</li>
</ol>
